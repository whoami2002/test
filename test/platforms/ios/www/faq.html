            <div class='question' >What is Selfie Share?</div>
            <div class='ans'>Selfie Share is a lively and quirky way to share selfies with friends. Snap a selfie, then say something to add meanings or fun. Friends will hear your narration when viewing it. You are not only taking a photo, but also telling a story.</div>
            </li>
            <li>
            <div class='question'> Could I share photo via other social platforms?</div>
            <div class='ans'>Yes, you could share your photo on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Flickr or Tumblr. In the last stage of uploading a photo, select platform(s) that you would like to post photo on. Then you could post photo to multiple platforms automatically.</div>
            </li>
            <li>
            <div class='question'>Could I forward the photo to Instant Messaging apps like WhatsApp?</div>
            <div class='ans'>Yes. There is an arrow button in bottom right of each photo. Click that button and share photos with friends via WhatsApp, WeChat or Line.</div>
            </li>
            <li>
            <div class='question'>Who can see my photo?</div>
            <div class='ans'>All photos are public by default, which means they are visible to anyone using Selfie Share. We would probably add "private" option in the near future.</div>
            </li>
            <li>
            <div class='question'>I have a technical problem or support issue I need resolved, who do I email?</div>
